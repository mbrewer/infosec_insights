## Session 2

### Commands
$ nslookup <domain>
$ whois <IP address>
$ dig <domain>
$ nc -v <IP address> <port>
$ netstat -ant
$ sslscan <domain>


### Questions asked
1. What is TLS?
2. What is DNS?
3. What is DHCP?

### Things I learned
- ISP blocks port 25, preventing you from sending email directly to mail exchange (I think)
- Therefore that blocks open-mail relays
- With weak security, you can connect directly to the server and send emails, including spoofing addresses


### Small notes
- Want to expedite your understanding of the material
- Take it in small portions
- Knowing how TCP/IP works is important
- Do you have XP with logs? Me: Yes, on Windows.

### Next steps
- Study, watch videos
- Focus on TCP / IP stuff (note to self: be able to explain this in plain English)
- Put your resume on job boards
